## What this app is built on:

This app is built solely on JavaScript, React, and Redux. On the serverside, this project communicates with a Rails api to manage database and calculation logics. 

You can find the link for the backend repo at:
[https://github.com/pjavadi84/pprolist-serverside]
### `To start:`

clone the repo and move into project directory
Once you open the project

run 'npm install'. It will install node modules and all depedencies. 

on command line, type npm start. The default port should be in any port you want, but it has to be run separate from where your back-end is running on.


The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# `App Structure:`

This app utilized based on static, dynamic components, action creators, and reducers.

### `Stateless component:`
These components are static or just built for presentational purposes and does not handle their own state:


- Navbar
- ProductsShow
- Vendor
- VendorsShow
- About

### `Stateful class components:`
This components contains classes and states in which data will flow between actions and reducers to do the manipulation. They are: 

- ProductForm
- VendorForm
- ProductContainer
- VendorContainer


Although simple, this project is the first project I have created both utilizing frontend and backend from scratch, built on React, and maintained state by Redux. I project personally gave me a full perspective on what things can be built on the web and how excited I am to share what I have learnt and what I can build for the future as a developer. 

Thank you

This is a test1 for branching and merging
